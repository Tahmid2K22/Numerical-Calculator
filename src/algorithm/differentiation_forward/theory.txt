Forward finite difference (numerical differentiation)

Purpose
- Approximate the first derivative from function values (or sampled data).

Formula
f'(x) approx (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h

Accuracy
- First-order accurate in h (truncation error is O(h)).

How to choose h (practical note)
- If h is too large: truncation error dominates (poor approximation).
- If h is too small: floating-point round-off can dominate because f(x+h)-f(x) may lose precision.
In practice, h is chosen based on the scale of x and the data precision.

When it is useful
- When you can evaluate (or measure) f at x and at a forward point x+h.
- Common in time-stepping data where “future” samples exist but “past” samples may not.
