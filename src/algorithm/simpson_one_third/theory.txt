Simpson’s 1/3 rule (numerical integration)

Goal
- Approximate the definite integral (integral from a to b of f(x) dx).

Idea
- On each pair of subintervals, fit a quadratic (parabola) through three points and integrate that polynomial.

Composite rule requirements
- The interval [a,b] is split into n equal subintervals where n must be even.
- Step size h = (b-a)/n.

Accuracy
- For smooth functions, the composite Simpson 1/3 rule has error O(h^4).

Notes
- Much more accurate than the trapezoidal rule for smooth functions.
- If f is not smooth, reducing h may be necessary.
