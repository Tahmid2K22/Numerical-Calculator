Naive matrix inversion

Goal
- Compute the inverse A^{-1} (if it exists) and use it to solve Ax=b as x = A^{-1} b.

Key facts
- A matrix is invertible only if det(A) != 0 (equivalently, A is non-singular).
- One way to compute an inverse is via row-reduction on [A | I] to obtain [I | A^{-1}].

Practical note
- In numerical computing, explicitly forming A^{-1} is usually discouraged:
	it is often slower and can amplify floating-point error compared to solving Ax=b directly.
- LU decomposition or Gaussian elimination is typically preferred for solving systems.
