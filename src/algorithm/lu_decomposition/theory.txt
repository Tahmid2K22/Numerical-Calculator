LU decomposition (linear systems)

Goal
- Solve Ax=b efficiently, especially for multiple right-hand sides.

Idea
- Factor A into A = L U where:
  - L is lower-triangular (often with 1s on the diagonal)
  - U is upper-triangular

How it solves Ax=b
1) Solve L y = b (forward substitution).
2) Solve U x = y (back substitution).

Notes
- Some matrices require pivoting (PA = LU) for numerical stability or to avoid zero pivots.
- Like Gaussian elimination, factorization is ~O(n^3), but each additional solve is ~O(n^2).
