Secant method (root finding)

Goal
- Find a root of f(x)=0 without computing derivatives.

Update rule
Uses the slope of the secant line through the last two iterates:
x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) * (x_n - x_{n-1}) / (f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}))

Stopping criteria
- |f(x_n)| < tolerance
- or |x_{n+1} - x_n| < tolerance
- or max iterations reached

Notes
- Often faster than bisection in practice.
- Not guaranteed to converge; can fail if f(x_n) and f(x_{n-1}) are too close (division by small number).
