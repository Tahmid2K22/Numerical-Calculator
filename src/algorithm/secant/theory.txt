Secant method (root finding)

Goal
- Find a root of f(x)=0 without computing derivatives.

Update rule
Uses the slope of the secant line through the last two iterates:
x(n+1) = x(n) - f(x(n)) * (x(n) - x(n-1)) / (f(x(n)) - f(x(n-1)))

Stopping criteria
- |f(x(n))| < tolerance
- or |x(n+1) - x(n)| < tolerance
- or max iterations reached

Notes
- Often faster than bisection in practice.
- Not guaranteed to converge; can fail if f(x(n)) and f(x(n-1)) are too close (division by small number).
