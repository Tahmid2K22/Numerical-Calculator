Newton–Raphson method (root finding)

Goal
- Find a root of f(x)=0 using tangent-line updates.

Update rule
x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)

Intuition
- Replace the function by its tangent line at x_n; the x-intercept of that line becomes x_{n+1}.

Stopping criteria
- |f(x_n)| < tolerance
- or |x_{n+1} - x_n| < tolerance
- or max iterations reached

Notes
- Converges very fast (often quadratic) when close to a simple root.
- Can fail if f'(x_n) is zero/small or the initial guess is poor.
- If the derivative is unavailable, the secant method approximates it.
