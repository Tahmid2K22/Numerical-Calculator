Newton–Raphson method (root finding)

Goal
- Find a root of f(x)=0 using tangent-line updates.

Update rule
x(n+1) = x(n) - f(x(n)) / f'(x(n))

Intuition
- Replace the function by its tangent line at x(n); the x-intercept of that line becomes x(n+1).

Stopping criteria
- |f(x(n))| < tolerance
- or |x(n+1) - x(n)| < tolerance
- or max iterations reached

Notes
- Converges very fast (often quadratic) when close to a simple root.
- Can fail if f'(x(n)) is zero/small or the initial guess is poor.
- If the derivative is unavailable, the secant method approximates it.
