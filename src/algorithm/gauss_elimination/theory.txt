Gaussian elimination (linear systems)

Goal
- Solve the linear system Ax=b.

Algorithm outline
1) Forward elimination: apply row operations to convert A into an upper-triangular matrix U.
2) Back substitution: solve Ux=b' starting from the last equation.

Pivoting (stability)
- Partial pivoting swaps rows to place a large (in magnitude) pivot element on the diagonal.
- This reduces numerical error and avoids division by very small numbers.

Notes
- If A is singular or nearly singular, elimination may fail or produce large errors.
- Complexity is roughly O(n^3) for an n×n system.
