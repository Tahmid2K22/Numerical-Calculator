Interpolation

Goal
- Estimate f(x) at points between known samples (x_i, y_i).

Definition
- Interpolation constructs a function p(x) such that p(x_i) = y_i for all data points.

Common approaches
- Lagrange form: builds p(x) as a weighted sum of basis polynomials.
- Newton divided differences: builds p(x) incrementally; efficient when adding new data points.

Notes / limitations
- High-degree polynomial interpolation over many points can oscillate (Runge phenomenon).
- Piecewise methods (splines) are often preferred for large datasets.
