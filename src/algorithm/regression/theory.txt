Regression (curve fitting)

Goal
- Fit a model to data when measurements may contain noise.

Least squares idea
- Choose model parameters to minimize the sum of squared residuals:
	minimize  Σ (y_i - y_hat(x_i))^2

Common models
- Linear: y = a + b x
- Polynomial: y = a0 + a1 x + ... + ak x^k
- Exponential: y = a e^{b x} (often linearized by taking log)
- Power law: y = a x^b (often linearized by taking log)

Notes
- Regression does not necessarily pass through every data point.
- Model choice should match the data trend; overfitting can occur with high-degree polynomials.
