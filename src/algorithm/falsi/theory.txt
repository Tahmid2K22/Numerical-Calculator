Regula Falsi / False Position (root finding)

Goal
- Find a root of f(x)=0 while keeping a bracketing interval [a,b] such that f(a)f(b) < 0.

Core idea
- Use the secant line through (a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)) to estimate the x-intercept:
	c = (a*f(b) - b*f(a)) / (f(b) - f(a))
Then replace either a or b with c so the sign-change bracket is preserved.

Stopping criteria
- |f(c)| < tolerance
- or |b-a| < tolerance
- or max iterations reached

Notes
- Often improves over bisection because it uses function values to “aim” toward the root.
- Can stagnate when one endpoint keeps getting selected; variants (Illinois, Pegasus) address this.
