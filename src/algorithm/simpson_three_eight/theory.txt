Simpson’s 3/8 rule (numerical integration)

Goal
- Approximate the definite integral \int_a^b f(x) dx.

Idea
- Fit a cubic polynomial through four equally spaced points (3 subintervals) and integrate the cubic.

Composite rule requirements
- Split [a,b] into n equal subintervals where n must be a multiple of 3.
- Step size h = (b-a)/n.

Accuracy
- For smooth functions, the composite Simpson 3/8 rule has error O(h^4).

Notes
- Similar accuracy order to Simpson 1/3; the choice may depend on how n is selected.
