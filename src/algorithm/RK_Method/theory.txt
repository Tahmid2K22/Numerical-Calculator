Runge–Kutta methods (ODE initial value problems)

Goal
- Approximate the solution to an initial value problem (IVP):
	y' = f(x,y),  y(x0)=y0

Idea
- Step forward from x(n) to x(n+1) = x(n) + h.
- Compute several slope estimates (k-values) inside the step and combine them.

Why it works well
- Compared to simple Euler’s method, RK methods reduce error by using more information about the slope across the interval.

Notes
- Step size h controls accuracy and stability.
- RK4 is a common default because it is accurate for many smooth problems without being too expensive.
