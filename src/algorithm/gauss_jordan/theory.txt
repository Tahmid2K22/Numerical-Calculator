Gauss–Jordan elimination (linear systems)

Goal
- Solve Ax=b by reducing the augmented matrix [A | b] to [I | x].

Algorithm outline
1) For each column (pivot position), scale the pivot row so the pivot becomes 1.
2) Eliminate the pivot column entries in all other rows (both above and below the pivot).
3) Continue until A becomes the identity matrix I.

Notes
- Produces the solution vector directly without a separate back-substitution step.
- Typically more arithmetic than Gaussian elimination; pivoting is still important for stability.
- Can also be used to compute inverses by reducing [A | I] to [I | A^{-1}].
