Bisection method (root finding)

Goal
- Find a root of f(x)=0 on an interval [a,b].

Requirement
- f is continuous on [a,b]
- f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs (f(a)f(b) < 0), so a root is bracketed.

Algorithm (core idea)
1) Compute midpoint m = (a+b)/2.
2) Decide which sub-interval still brackets a root:
	- If f(a)f(m) < 0, set b = m.
	- Else set a = m.
3) Repeat until the interval is small enough.

Stopping criteria
- |b-a| < tolerance (interval width)
- or |f(m)| < tolerance
- or max iterations reached

Properties / notes
- Guaranteed convergence under the continuity + sign-change condition.
- Convergence is linear; the interval shrinks by ~1/2 per iteration.
- Works best when you can reliably bracket a single root.
