Backward finite difference (numerical differentiation)

Purpose
- Approximate the first derivative using values behind x.

Formula
f'(x) \approx (f(x) - f(x-h)) / h

Accuracy
- First-order accurate in h (truncation error O(h)).

Practical note on h
- Very small h can amplify round-off error; very large h increases truncation error.

When it is useful
- When you have samples at x and earlier points (x-h).
- Common in streaming scenarios where “past” data is available but “future” values are not.
