Project theory (overview)

Numerical methods are algorithms that approximate solutions to mathematical problems when an exact closed-form solution is not available (or is expensive to compute). They are widely used in engineering and scientific computing because many real problems involve noisy data, non-linear equations, or large systems that cannot be solved symbolically.

This project groups several core topics:
- Root finding for non-linear equations (solve f(x)=0)
- Solving linear systems Ax=b and related matrix operations
- Interpolation and regression for data-based modeling
- Numerical differentiation and numerical integration
- Numerical ODE solvers (initial value problems)

How this project runs:
- The driver in src/main.cpp reads an operation keyword from ../tests/input.txt.
- Based on that keyword, it calls the corresponding implementation under src/algorithm/.
- Results are written to ../tests/output.txt.

Good practice notes:
- Many methods require assumptions (e.g., continuity for bracketing methods, non-singular matrices for linear solvers).
- The choice of step size (h), tolerance, and iteration limits strongly affects accuracy and stability.
